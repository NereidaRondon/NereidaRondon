    <h2>About me...</h2>

    <p>
      ✨With my cocktail of experiences in the food service industry, retail,
      and in the classroom I can be a valuable addition to any team. As a
      cheerleader of technology and its capabilities, I look forward to
      continuing my journey into the tech industry by training, learning,
      practicing, and continue to improve.
    </p>

    <p>
      ✨I’m a natural problem solver, always up for a challenge or finding ways
      to make a process more efficient. For example, as the teacher sponsor of
      Student Council, I upgraded the voting system from paper to electronic by
      using the concatenate function on excel to create a unique password for
      each student, that was used to access a google form ballot and it
      separated the responses by grade level. I did this to streamline the
      voting process, make it easier to tally votes, and to keep the election
      process fair.

    <p>
      I love to create, whether it's a math unit on triangles or a web page it
      doesn't matter, I'm in my happy place when I can . I thrive when creating
      things for others to interact with.
    </p>

    <p>
      ✨ I am an efficient communicator and enjoy collaborating with peers, as
      well as guiding and training inexperienced team members. I have provided
      technical support to other teachers through email and over the phone.
      Also, I have provided technical support for students, in person, via
      email, and chatting in google classroom. If I don't know the solution, I
      will find it.
    </p>

    <p>
      ✨I have over 10 years of work experience in education that involved using
      various educational technology platforms. If anything is constant in the
      Education field, it is CHANGE. By keeping an open mind and being hands-on,
      I am always able to learn new technologies without fear.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am a great listener... I always admit when I'm wrong because its not
      that common... I love a challenge because finding viable solutions is
      always so satisfying... I make people laugh.
